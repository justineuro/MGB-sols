As this version of the manual has not been thoroughly proofread, it would be greatly appreciated if you can inform yours truly, through the `Issues` section of this repository or by email: [justineuro@gmail.com](mailto:justineuro@gmail.com), of any typographical errors that you spot (you may also send a `git pull` request for purposes related to this). Looking forward to collaborating with you, many thanks!

(Note: This version of the solutions manual contains errata that have already been implemented in the 3rd edition of MGB.)
